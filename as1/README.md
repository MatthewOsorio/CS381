## How to run program
Copy and make these commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./as1
```

## Extra Credit
For extra credit I added a John Rambo mesh to the window. I added "john_rambo.glb" to the meshes file, I configured the file using the cmake method "configure_file()" to be able to load the mesh. I loaded it and you should see the John Rambo model.
